\section{Introduction}\label{sect:intro}

Observations of massive early-type galaxies at $z\sim0$ show a trend of stellar IMF with galaxy mass, with the most massive systems having on average a heavier IMF \citep{Tre++10,Cap++12}.
Efforts have been put into reproducing from a theoretical standpoint the observed IMF trends. However, despite recent progress, we still lack a coherent description of star formation across all environments.
The variation in the IMF might be the result of different conditions in the star-forming gas in different galaxies \citep{Hop13}.
One complication in comparing measurements of the IMF with models is that present day stellar populations are ensembles of stars formed a different epochs in a range of environments.
For massive early-type gaalxies, a significant fraction of their present day stellar mass is believed to be accreted from other systems \citep{vDo++10}.
If the IMF is not universal, then each accreted object will in general have a different IMF from the preexisting population of the central galaxy.
The IMF of a massive galaxy at $z=0$ will then be combination of the IMF of the stellar population formed in-situ and that of the accreted galaxies.
How does this "effective" IMF evolve in time?

In this work we model the evolution of the effective IMF of massive galaxies from $z=2$ to the present.
We adopt a simple prescription for assigning the starting IMF of an ensemble of galaxies and then evolve the stellar population of central galaxies by merging their stellar content with that of accreted satellites.

We tune our model to match the observed IMF-stellar mass trend at $z=0$ and use it to make predictions on the stellar IMF at higher redshifts.

The paper is organized as follows.  In \Sref{sect:model} we describe our model.
In \Sref{sect:results} we show our predictions on the time evolution of the IMF.
We discuss our results in \Sref{sect:discuss} and draw conclusions in \Sref{sect:concl}.

\section{The model}\label{sect:model}

\subsection{Parameters and notation}
Throughout our work we use the following quantities to describe the stellar content of our galaxies. We first define a true stellar mass, $\mtrue$. Then we introduce a Chabrier stellar mass, $\mchab$, defined as the stellar mass one would infer by fitting a stellar population synthesis model based on a Chabrier IMF to broad-band photometric data. This quantity is tipically used when observationally measuring stellar masses.
We then introduce an {\em IMF mismatch parameter}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:aimf}
\aimf = \frac{\mtrue}{\mchab}.
\end{equation}
Stellar populations with a more bottom-heavy IMF than a Chabrier IMF will have $\alpha>1$. A Salpeter IMF for example corresponds tipically to a value $\aimf\approx1.8$.
As defined above, $\aimf$ is a well-defined quantity also for galaxies that do not have a homogeneous stellar population, for example as a result of mergers.

In addition to the stellar mass of a galaxy, we track its halo mass $\mhalo$ and its central velocity dispersion $\sigma$.
Stellar mass, halo mass and stellar velocity dispersion are the only quantities that enter our model.


\subsection{The mock sample}

We generate a sample of halo masses drawn from the halo mass function described by \citet{Tin++08}.
We then assign a Chabrier stellar mass to each halo using a stellar to halo mass relation (SHMR) from \citet{Lea++12}, including scatter.
We make a cut in stellar mass keeping only galaxies with $\log{\mchab} > 10.8$ and then select a random sample of 100 objects.
Finally we assign central velocity dispersions using the $M_*-\sigma$ relation measured by \citet{Aug++10} for low-z objects, generalized to higher redshifts ($z \sim 2$) following \citet{Mas++15}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mason}
\log{\sigma} = 2.34 + 0.18(\log{\mchab} - 11) + 0.20\log{(1 + z)}.
\end{equation}



\subsection{The IMF}
\label{ssect:imfform}

The IMF of massive galaxies has been shown to correlate with stellar velocity dispersion \citep[e.g.]{Tre++10, CvD12, LaB++13, Spi++14, Pos++15}, stellar mass \citep{Aug++10b, Son++15}, mass-to-light ratio \citep{Cap++12} and stellar mass density \citep{Spi++15}.
In light of these observations, we adopt the following two prescriptions for assigning the IMF of our galaxies.
In the first prescription, labeled ``$M_*$ model'', we assume the following linear relation between IMF mismatch parameter and stellar mass:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mstarmodel}
\log{\aimf} = a_*(\log{\mchab} - 11) + b_*,
\end{equation}
with $a_* = 0.5$ and $b_* = 0.0$. %These values have been chosen to match the measurements by \citet{Aug++10b} and \citet{Son++15} at low redshift ($z\sim 0.2-0.3$).
The second prescription, labeled ``$\sigma$ model'', consists in a linear relation between stellar velocity dispersion and IMF mismatch parameter:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sigmamodel}
\log{\aimf} = a_\sigma(\log{\sigma} - 2.3) + b_\sigma,
\end{equation}
with $a_\sigma = 2.0$ and $b_\sigma = 0.0$.
These prescriptions are purely empirically motivated.
While there have been attempts at predicting the stellar IMF from first principles in terms of the global properties of a galaxy \citep[e.g.]{Kru11,Hop12}, implementing such models would require us to make additional assumptions on parameters of the star forming gas such as the pressure and the turbulence Mach number.
Given the current uncertainty on the true mechanism determining the IMF, the benefits of employing such theoretically motivated recipes are modest and we therefore limit our model to simpler empirical recipes.
We show that the main results of this study hold for a range of different prescriptions for assigning the IMF.




\subsection{The dry merger evolution}

Our central galaxies are evolved to $z=0$ using the dry merger evolution model developed by \citet{Nip++12}.
The method can be summarized as follows.
For each central galaxy we first compute the evolution in its halo mass due to mergers.
This is done by averaging over contributions from mergers with halo mass ratios $0.03 < \xi < 1$, with rates informed from the Millennium simulation.
The halo mass derived at each timestep is therefore that of a halo with an average merger history.
We then calculate the growth in Chabrier stellar mass assuming that each merged halo is associated with a stellar mass given by the (redshift dependent) SHMR of \citet{Lea++12}, and that this stellar mass is also accreted by the central galaxy.
In order to calculate the change in the true stellar mass, we need to define the IMF of the satellite galaxies. We assign the IMF to satellites using the same recipe used for the central. For the ``$M_*$ model'' the quantity determining the IMF is the stellar mass of the satellite. For the ``$\sigma$ model'' instead we need to specify the velocity dispersion of the satellite. In that case we use \Eref{eq:mason} to assign a velocity dispersion to the satellite and then use it to calculate the IMF.
This procedure is not entirely self-consistent, since our recipes are intended to describe the IMF at $z=2$ while mergers can occur at any redshift. In principle, satellites themselves can merge between $z=2$ and the time they are accreted, resulting in a change in their IMF. This however is a higher order effect that would only marginally distort the relations between satellite parameters and IMF. 
Finally, we calculate the change in central velocity dispersion due to mergers with an analytical expression calibrated on high resolution N-body simulations of collisonless mergres (Eq. 30 of \citet{Nip++12}). 
With this description, dry mergers tend to decrease the central velocity dispersion, the effect being larger in minor mergers than in major mergers for the same amount of accreted stellar mass.

Note that we do not keep track of the spatial distribution of stars within our galaxies. Although observations could in principle detect spatial variations in IMF within a galaxy and put interesting constraints on IMF differences between the in-situ population and that of the accreted stars, that is beyond the scope of this work.

\section{Results}\label{sect:results}

In \Fref{fig:snap} we plot the IMF mismatch parameter for our mock sample of galaxies at three different redshifts ($z=2$, $z=1$ and $z=0$), as a function of stellar mass and velocity dispersion.
The trend of $\aimf$ with stellar mass, which we assumed in place at the formation, is mostly preserved by dry mergers down to $z=0$, but is less steep.
