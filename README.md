# IMF evolution in a dry merger scenario

Hypothesis: the stellar IMF of a galaxy when its stars are formed depends on the density of the halo at the time of formation.

The IMF of a galaxy will then change as it merges with objects with different IMFs.

We define the "effective IMF" as the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and the stellar mass we would infer from a perfect stellar population synthesis measurement on the galaxy SED.
Both the true stellar mass and the SPS stellar mass add linearly with dry mergers.

We want to predict the z=0 distribution in the effective IMF.
